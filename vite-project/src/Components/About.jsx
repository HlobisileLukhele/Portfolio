            <p> Frontend developer with a passion for coding and creating responsive and functional web applications.
               My journey in web development began when I enrolled in coding bootcamps to learn the necessary skills to become a developer.
               Since then, I have continued to learn and grow as a developer, and I am constantly exploring new technologies and techniques to improve my skills.
               When I'm not coding, I enjoy  going for jogs and exploring music.  </p>
